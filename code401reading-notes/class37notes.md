# Class 37 Notes React

## Why is this important?

- ES6 implements features that simplify variable declarations and introduces arrow functions.

- Utility classes make styling easier allowing for more time to be spent on actual code.

- Next.js gives react apps the cability to be server side rendered to users, effectivly streamlining the rendering process.

## Reading Questions

1. The three key features introduced into JavaScript ES6 are: the `let` variable declaration, which allows for block-hosted variables that cannot be redeclared.  The `const` declaration, which does not let a variable be reassigned and is not immutable.  The last are arrow functions which allows devs to create a function in less code.

2. Utility classes in Tailwind allows dev to implement styling to their code without having to write their own custom CSS allowing for more time to be spent on other code. To add TailwindCSS into your code you create a class attribute with your custom styling for ex. : `<p class="text-slate-500">You have a new message!</p>`

3. The main advantages of using Next.js are that you can use react apps alongside server side rendering.  Server Side Rendering (SSR) just means your react app can rendered on a server.  Other advantages are Static Site Generation(SSG) means you can pre render your application and File System Routing which is a routes are built based on files in your application.  Traditional Client Side Rendering and Server Side Rendering differ in the aspect that SSR will send the entire rendered webpage to the user allowing the application to be immediately viewed compared to Client Side which initially loads the HTML then the JavaScript necessary to view the page.

- How do companies adjust their code from different versions of JavaScript? Do they have to refactor all of their code at once?
