# Class 16 Notes Serverless Functions

## Why is this important

- Serverless computing is great for utilizing machines and setting up storage for data without having to provision your own hardware.

- APIs allow devs to use external information in their applications.

## Reading Questions

- The key characteristics of serverless computing are it takes milliseconds to provision them, there is no administrative burden, magaged by the provider, auto-scale, no need to plan for capacity, they are stateless, and have high availability.  

- To get started with Vercel all you need to do is create an account, select a plan and choose your framework

- An Application Programming Interface(API) is a comuncation layer that allows systems to talk to eachother with out having to understand exactly what the others do. [source](https://realpython.com/python-api/)  In Python, make sure you have the `requests` library installed which will let you use the majority of APIs out there.  External APIs that have data can be consumed and manipulated in Python.

- The requests library allows users to fetch data from a huge variety of external APIs with the normal HTTP requests syntax: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE`. An example of a get request would be `response = requests.get('an-api-website.com/api')`

## Things I want to know more about
