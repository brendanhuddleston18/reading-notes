# Class 31 Notes Django REST Framework and Docker

## Why is this important?

- DRF Permissions are important for the security of the application

- Generic Views are great for code reusability, increasing deployment speed and consistency amongst views and apps in general

## Reading Questions

1. The key components of the of the DRF permissions are the Permission Classes.  Permission classes determine if any request is allowed to proceed, they are also flexible and easy to use.

2. In SQL, the SELECT statement allows you to retrieve data from the database.  You can specify which contents you want to fetch as well, for example: `SELECT * FROM employess;`

3. DRF Generic Views allow you to quickly build API views that map closely to your database models. [source](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/)  The Generic Views implement view pattern that limit the amount of code the Dev has to write.  An example of using a Generic View involves implementing it to handle standard CRUD operations, significantly simplifying the process.
