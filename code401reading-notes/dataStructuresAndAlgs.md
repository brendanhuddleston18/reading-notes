# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Why is this important?

- Recursion is important for simplicity and readability.  It allows devs to navigate through nested functions.

- Data structures and choosing the right one to maintain efficiency while solving or running complex problems.

## Discussion Questions

1. One of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the big O notation and how long will the operation of the data structure take if the complexity is increased.

2. We can ensure that we'll avoid an infinite recursive call stack by implementing a base case (gives a reason for the loop to stop)

## Things I want to know more about 

- What are some real world use cases of recursive functions?
