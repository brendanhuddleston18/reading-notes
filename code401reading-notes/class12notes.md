# Reading Class 12

## Why is this important?

- The Pandas library makes visualizing and manipulating data from datasets too easy.  It is used in everything data.

## Reading Questions

1. The Pandas library is ideal for analyzing data, data science and machine learning.  You can load, prepare, manipulate, merge and model data. It also is great for data visualization.[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcqPhpY7tWk&t=391s)

2. The primary data structures in Pandas are `series` and `DataFrame`.  A series is a "one-dimensional labeled array holding data of any type" while DataFrames are "a two-dimensional data structure that holds data like a two-dimension array or a table with rows and columns" [source](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)

3. After you import the pandas library and assign its alias as `pd` you can then read whatever file you are trying to load with the built in `read` and whatever format the file is in. Ex. `pd.read_csv('file.csv')`.  Some common file formats are csv, json and SQL.

## What do I want to know more about?

- Can Pandas only be used in notebooks?
