# Readings: Ethics

- The first article I read for "Ethics in the Workplace" was: The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of by Bill Sourour [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e).  First of all, this article moved me and I really tried to put myself in the position that he was in.  Being a part of the marketing that could've been the reason a young girl took her own life would have my mind racing and think I would have resigned as well.  I will definitely be taking the approach of understanding and thinking about how my code might effect people in the real world.  

- For the second article: "Will Democracy Survive Big Data and AI", I thought it was alarming how much technology, especially AI is expanding.  I enjoy tech obviously, or I wouldn't be in this course, but to think our entire lives will be governed by technology is insane.  The part where the article mentioned "persuasive computing" is something I really have a problem with and is part of the reason I'm not on social media anymore.  Technology and its various algorithms created by others who can manipulate a population into thinking or believing in the creators' ideas and beliefs is something I can't get behind.  As much as I want to be a great developer and contribute to society, I value the ability for everyone to think for themselves and have their own opinions on topics.  I don't want people to believe in what I believe unless it's their organic thought process.
