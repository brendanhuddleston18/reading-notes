# Class 39 Notes React 3

## Why is this important?

- React and Next.js are important for creating dynamic, server side rendered applications.  Context eliminates the need for props to be passed down throughout components that might not need them.

## Reading Questions

1. React Context allows data to be passed down to different components without the use of props.  It solves the problem of having to pass data through components that might not need it.

2. The `useContext` hook makes components more concise by allowing devs to consume context values efficiently in your component without needing a consumer component.  It can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component by providing a context value which allows any component to use the data.  Second, you must consume the value inside of the functional component and store it inside of a variable for use.

3. Next.js enables Server Side Rendering, and makes it easier for developers to build fast, scalable and userfriendly web applications.
