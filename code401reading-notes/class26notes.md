# Class 26 Notes Intro to Django

## Why is this important?

- Django and Tailwind CSS are important because they make the developer's life easier, allowing them to focus more on the actual writing of the application.  

## Reading Questions

1. The key components of the Django framework are the Architecture, URL Dispatcher, Admin Interface, Forms, Auth, Middleware and caching.  They simplify and improve web development by efficiently handling the web development process allowing devs to focus solely on writing the application.

2. Model-Template-View Architecture defines the data structure, manages the presentation layer and returns web responses based on requests.

3. Tailwind CSS is a framework for customizing applications that allow the dev to use less custom CSS.  It differs from bootstrap in the ways that it doesn't offer fully styled components but offers utility classes instead so you can create your own reusable components.
