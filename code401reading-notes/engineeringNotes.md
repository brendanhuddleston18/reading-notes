# Engineering Readings 

1. The one thing I bring to this career is passion and drive.  I’m the type of individual where if I’m working towards something, I want to be obsessed with it and know everything about it.  I also make sure whatever the task is, it’s done correctly and efficiently the first time.  Nothing drives me up the wall more than redoing my own work that could’ve been right initially.

2. The first thing I need to do more of to “un-stick” myself especially with coding is take more breaks and get away from the computer.  I’m very bad at pacing myself with work and want to do as much as I can until I get burnt out.  In Code 301 I took more breaks and definitely was appreciative of those moments of relaxation.  The second thing I’d like to start doing more is solve the problem without code.  By that I mean, write/say what I want to happen(or what needs to happen) in order to complete the lab or goal.  I noticed that each time I mapped out what needs to happen it made the code easier to write.  The last thing I’d like to do more in order to “un-stick” myself is asking for help with my classmates or future teammates.  I have a bad tendency of just trying to solve everything on my own which has led me to take longer than necessary on some assignments, plus there has been instances where I would’ve finished sooner if I had just asked someone at my table to look at my code.
