# The Command Line Notes

## The Command Line

### What is It? 

- The Command Line is an interface that allows users to instruct their computer by entering text based commands and receiving feedback through text.

### How does it Work?

- The user will enter commands in the terminal, based on the commands the computer will display necessary information that it was prompted.

### How do I get to one?

- Depending on the OS, you can usually find the terminal(to use the command line) under applications and utilities.

- Once the terminal is found, you can also create a shortcut to it so it can be accessed easily.

## Basic Navigation

- Absolute Path: The location and route of a file from the root directory (begin with forward slash `/`)

- Relative Path: The location and route of a file from the current directory (No slash)

- `~` Will take you back to your home directory

- The user can also use the "tab" key on their keyboard to auto complete a file/directory instead of having to type out the entire thing.

## More About Files

- "Everything is a File"

- Linux is extensionless, meaning files in Linux will not have the trail text that denotes what type of file it is Ex: `picture.png`

- Linux is also case sensitive.

- `ls -a` Will list all of the files in the current directory including the hidden files.  `a.` will determine if a file is hidden or not.

## Manual Pages

- Manual Pages are documents that will provide the user every command available to them on their OS.

- If you need to search for a specific command's manual pageyou can use `man (followed by the command)`.

- `man -k (followed by the search term)` will provide the user with every manual page that includes the provided search term. 

## File Manipulation

- `mv` can be used to either move a file/directory or also rename it

- `rm-r` will remove a directory that isn't empty.  (It'll also remove it's contents).
