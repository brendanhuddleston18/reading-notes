# Growth to Mindset 

## Why is it important?

- Mindset and understanding biases are important for cohesive teams.  People have inherit biases but in today's day and age understanding and respecting another individual's background, experience, story is vital to success

- Understanding ones own emotional intelligence is great for teams because it allows team members to understand their flaws and allowing them to create a goal to improve on them and become a more efficient team member.

## Assessing Emotional Intelligence and Biases

### Emotional Intelligence

- So the second time taking this assessment, I scored a little differently.  My new lowest score was self-awareness(16).  I think I can be a little clouded sometimes with my self awareness but that is something I’m actively trying to improve.  My highest this time had changed from Self-management to Social Awareness, which was my lowest the first time I had taken this assessment.  I do feel like I am able to interpret and analyze what individuals are trying to convey as well as their body language.  I’m confused how I scored so low on that the first time.  Relationship and Self Management were both tied with 16 points.

### Biases 

- After some bias based power hours in 301, my eyes have opened more in regards to the importance of identifying and preventing biases within the work place.  I still think I have some room to grow and definitely need to open my mind a little more when interacting with people from other backgrounds.  I definitely need to work on getting to know everyone on my team, I have a bad tendency of keeping it completely professional and don’t like bringing up more personal topics.  One thing I’d like to improve on is fully assessing a situation and not just reacting off of my gut feeling or emotions.  I hope that addressing biases is a topic we focus on in 401 as much as we did in 301.

## What do I want to know

- What are some every day things I can do to improve my emotional intelligence?

- How can you help team members shift away from biases they might have had from their childhood or upbringing?

- Are some biases good?
