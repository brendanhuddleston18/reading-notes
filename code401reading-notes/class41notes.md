1. Dynamic Routes are used to implement routing between pages without knowing the data ahead of time.  They're different from static routes which are manually configured, while dynamic routes are created and updated manually.

2. The steps to deploy a next.js application are: create the application using NPX `npx create-next-app@latest`, push to github remote repo, deploy on vercel.  Some of the popular deployment platforms are Vercel, Netlify, AWS and Heroku.

3. Next.js serves static files in the `public` directory in your root directory.  You can reference them in your code by using the `/filename` format.  Next.js does this to increase performance and improve load time of the static files in your application.
