## Why is this important?

- Shutil and os are modules intended for file/directory manipulation, easing both.

## Reading Questions

- You can use regex to parse strings based on certain characters or character traits.  The module to work with them is `re`

- The shutil module handles high-level file operations like copying and moving files/directories.  A common use case would be copying and moving a file: `shutl.copy(src, dest)`

- shutil and os both deal with file and directory operation.  Shutil is better at high level(more complex) while os is best at low level. You would use os to rename and remove a specific file.  Shutil is great at moving directories and archiving operations.
