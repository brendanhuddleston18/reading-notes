# Class 18 Notes Cryptography

## Why is this important?

- Encryption/Decryption is important for the securing of important data.  Dealt a lot with encryption/decryption in the army while using radio, digital communications.

## Reading Questions

- The basic principle of Caesars Cipher is: Whatever the regular message contains you replace each letter with a letter shifted by a certain amount.  Julius Caesar would use this method to encrypt messages.

- Symmetric Encryption: The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt and can be used to encrypt files on a disk or data in transit.  Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a public and private key, one for encrypting and the other for decrypting.  Asymmetric Encryption is mostly used for digital signatures and securing channels through something that might not be secure.

- Computers generate random numbers with True Random Number Generation (TRNG) which generates numbers completely randomly(they don't have a sequence) and are used for key generation. Computers can also use Pseudo-Random Number Generation(PRNG): which produces a sequence of numbers that eventually repeat and are used for more general cryptography and testing.

- Encryption is securing whatever message or data and decrypting is unpacking it.  An analogy is locking a door(encryption) and unlocking the door(decryption)
