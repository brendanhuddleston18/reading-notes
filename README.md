### What is Growth Mindset to me?

Growth Mindset to me is the ability to learn and adapt to ongoing situations and willingness to learn despite challenges that might arise!

I have 3 reminders that I tell myself in order to maintain a  _growth mindset_ :

- **Stay Positive**, being in a good mental spot always helps with learning new info!
- **Ask Questions**, don't feel embarrassed to ask questions.  Everyone starts somewhere.
- **Don't give up!** Obstacles are necessary for learning

## Reading 01: Learning Markdown

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language, used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

### Why do we use Markdown?

- _Multi-use_: Websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- _Portable_: Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any app.  Not like word processing apps (Microsoft Word, etc.)
- _Platform Independent_: You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any OS.
- _Future Proof_: If the app. you're using stops working at some point in the future, you'll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing app.
- _Markdown is EVERYWHERE!_: Reddit, GITHUB and other sites/apps support Markdown

### What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?

- The heading symbol in Markdown is '#'
- In order to place the largest heading you only use one '#'
- In order to place the smallest heading you need to use three '###'

### When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

- The '*' is the best practice symbol for making text **bold** (using two '**') and one for *italics*

### How do you create a link with Markdown?

- In order to create a link you need to first create a link name with the square brackets [] followed by the link in parenthesis ()
