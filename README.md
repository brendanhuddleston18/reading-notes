### What is Growth Mindset to me?

Growth Mindset to me is the ability to learn and adapt to ongoing situations and willingness to learn despite challenges that might arise!

I have 3 reminders that I tell myself in order to maintain a _growth mindset_ :

- **Stay Positive**, being in a good mental spot always helps with learning new info!
- **Ask Questions**, don't feel embarrassed to ask questions. Everyone starts somewhere.
- **Don't give up!** Obstacles are necessary for learning -->
