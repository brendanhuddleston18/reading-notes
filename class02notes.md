### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
1. **Code completion** which will display possible suggestions based on what you are currently typing.
2. **Syntax highlighting** which will colorize your text based on attributes.
3. **A nice variety of themes** which will allow you to change the overall color of the text editor. (Instead of the text, this effects the background of the editor)
4. **Variety of extensions** which act as plugins for your text editor, allowing different capabilities and tools.

### What do the following commands do?
1. *pwd* "Print Working Directory"- displays which directory(folder) you are currently in
2. *ls* "List"- Lists the contents of the current directory
3. *cd* "Change Directory"- Changes the current directory to whatever you specify
4. *mkdir* "Make Directory" - Makes a new directory inside the folder you're currently in
5. *touch* - Makes a new file inside the folder you're currently in

### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?
1. *cd projects* Changes current directory to the *projects* folder
2. *mkdir new-project* Makes a new directory called *new-project* (In the projects folder)
3. *touch new-project/newfile.md* Makes a new markdown file called *newfile* (In the new-project folder)
