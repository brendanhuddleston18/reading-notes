## Reading Class 06

## Why is this important?

- Psych safety is important to ensure cohesive teams that enjoy work and will increase efficiency

- HTTP Protocols are important to understand how the internet processes requests.

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. The lack of psych safety really interfered with progress not only for me but my team as well.  It created a very toxic environment where no one wanted to come to work and everyone complained.

2. It definitely motivates me to be better, I need to be more inclusive and stray away from the I can do it all mentality.

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. "Roy Fielding helped write the first webserves, that sent docs. across the internet" [source](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

2. The techniques we use in class don't work well because the dev techniques don't have the requirement to talk to machine's all over the world?

3. A `GET` uses a user inputted URL and returns the corresponding webpage.

4. "The HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created is about applying verbs to nouns" [source](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

5. "A `POST` allows a system to add something to another system" [source](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

5. A `PUT` is used when a system wants to replace something in another system

6. A `patch` is used when the devs need to release a partial update.

## Things I want to learn?

1. Still confused on question two of the REST reading.
