## Reading 07 NODE.JS


## Why is this important?

- Node and NPM allow us to run JS on the server, utilize JS via the browser and install different libraries and tools to assist with our JS.

- Pair programming benefits the actual software development skills and improves listening, speaking, reading, writing

## An Intro to Node.js on sitepoint.com

1. Node.js is an asynchronous, event-based, non-blocking runtime that uses Google's V8 JS Engine. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/node.js/info)

2. Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine is an efficient code compiler that is able to translate developer written code into code that computers understand.

3. A runtime allows a coding language to be written and run with functionality. " In the case of Node.js, it is a runtime for JavaScript, allowing JavaScript code to be executed outside of a web browser, typically on servers, by leveraging the V8 JavaScript engine." [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

4. NPM(Node Package Manager) is used to install and manage different tools devs can use with JS. Also if you go to the NPM site and click the text in the top left it changes to different acronyms of NPM [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

5. v20.8.0

6. 10.1.0

7. npm install jshint

8. Node lets us run JS on the server.  [source](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. The six reasons for pair programming are: Greater efficiency, Engaged Collaboration, Learning from Fellow Students, Social Skills, Job Interview Readiness, Work Environment Readiness.

2. Learning from fellow students has benefitted me the most.  There have been times in both the code challenges and labs that I have been stuck on something and after getting a second set of eyes from a classmate, the problem was resolved quickly.

3. Pair programming works with Driver/Navigator pairs.  One individual(Driver) writes the code while the Other(Navigator) looks over their shoulder and advises/explains what to do next.
