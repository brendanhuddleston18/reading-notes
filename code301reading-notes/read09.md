## Functional Programming Concepts

1. "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data" [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

2. A pure function is a function that is determined by it's parameters and doesn't have side effects.

3. The benefits of a pure function are that if you continue to pass the same parameters you are guaranteed a certain return.

4. "When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it's created." [source](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa);

5. Referential Transparency is when a function does not depend on state in the application and only requires input into its parameters.
