## Why is this important?

- Creating forms with React is important because you are able to use user data and store it in state in order to apply it somewhere else.

- Ternary operators are important because the reduce the amount of code you have to write (should've learned this earlier!)

## How to use forms in React

1. A 'Controlled Component' is a component controlled by the state inside of the react component.

2. We should wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form because the there is better management over the forms state.  

3. We can target what the user is entering by using the same method in JS. `event.target.value`

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. We would use a ternary operator to simplify a conditional statement. 

2. `x === y ? true : false;`

### Questons

- Wouldn't storage method of user response depend on situation?
