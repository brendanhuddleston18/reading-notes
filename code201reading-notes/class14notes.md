## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are allowing for individuals to be themselves at work. "No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home" Teams should be able to talk about hard conversations in order to bond and feel close to eachother. Teams shouldn't just be focused on efficiency but truly understand and feel that their work matters and their voices are being heard.

2. Well I was apart of a whole bunch of teams in the Army.  Let me know you, psych. safety is not a priority (at least in most combat mos roles).  As a member of a unit you aren't really encouraged to talk about tough subjects and personal life or what is actually going on.  I've met some great leaders who would sit down and listen but the majority of leaders I've witnessed were just worried about the mission and not about the regular soldiers and what's going on in there life.

3. Teams that operate with a high degree of psych. safety are not only happier but more efficient.  If individuals come into work without dreading that they're going to work, the tasks at hand are more likely to be accomplished.  I've been apart of teams where myself and my peers are absolutely miserable and burnt out and leadership would wonder why we hated our lives and never wanted to go above and beyond.
