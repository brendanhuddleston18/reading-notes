# Class 01 Reading Notes

## Getting Started

1. HTTP, HyperText Transfer Protocol utilizes ports in order to send packets or data between computers via the Internet or Ethernet

2. I like to think of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as parts of the human body in regards to a website. What I mean by that is that HTML is the skeletal system, it provides the foundation to the website. CSS is the skin and other cosmetic features, it goes off the HTML and makes the website pretty and appealing to look at. JavaScript is the muscular system because it allows the website to be dynamic and have functionality tailored to the user.

3. You can use stock images or even Google's license filter. Some stock image websites are unsplash.com and squoosh.app

4. A string data type is created using the single quotes: `'String'` or `'5'` while numbers lack the single quote: `5`.

5. A variable in JavaScript is a box or container used to store values, for example. `let myName = 'Brendan';` The container or variable is `myName` and the content of the variable(container) is the string `'Brendan'`. They are important in JavaScript in order to create dynamic programming like prompting the user for their name and then personalizing an alert with the user input.
