# Reading Class 12 Chart.js, Canvas

## Why is this important

- Canvas and Chart.js are important to learn and know because they allow the developer to present data in a very appealing and easier to understand way.  Chart's are a lot easier to read and look a lot more professional/modern than tables

## JavaScript Canvas

1. `<canvas>` lets the developer draw 2D graphics using JavaScript

2. The closing `</canvas>` tag is important because any content between the opening and closing tag is fallback content if the users browser doesn't support the `<canvas>` tag.

3. `getContext()` "Returns a render context object". [source](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)

## Chart.js Documentation

1. Chart.js is a library that provides a set of charts, plugins, and graphs for data visualization.  It is compatible with all popular JS frameworks.  It is highly customizable with custom plugins. You need to input the script like how you do with `app.js` [source](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)

2. 3 different charts you can create using Chart.js are Area Charts, radar chart and scatter charts.

## Easily create stunning animated charts with Chart.js

1. Some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table are that they're easier to look at and convey data more quickly than tables. [source](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/) 

2. Charts will make the information more appealing to read.  This makes sense to me because the tables in HTML(at least in salmon cookies) were not appealing at all.  They also help with identifying trends, comparison and data simplificaiton. -ChatGPT

## Things I want to know more about
