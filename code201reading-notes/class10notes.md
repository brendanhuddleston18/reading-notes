# Class 10 Reading Debuggin

## Why is this important?

- This section is important as a developer because it informs you on the tools you can utilize to figure out why you're code isn't working the way you intended.  Also explains what the difference between a syntax and logic error are. (I did not know the difference at first)

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. A syntax error will cause the program to not work or stop working part way through, they can include spelling errors.  Usually have error messages to help you fix them.  A logic error is where the code isn't working as intended like giving incorrect results.  No error message.

2. Too many syntax errors to count.  Love how VS code will usually catch them and underline them for me.  If VS Code misses it the console usually catches it.  Trying to get in the habit of keeping the Dev. Tools Console open while I work on labs.  I feel like the most common errors I get are from missing or too many semi colons.  Or not defining a variable.

3. This topic influences me to double check my  code and keep an eye out for possible errors to allow my code to run more smoothly (and to just be a better programmer in general).  Like I mentioned in the last question, the console has been a good friend for spotting those errors.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. The JavaScript debugger tool is similar to a pause button on a movie that allows you to halt the execution of the code where it's at and isolate the problem of why your code isn't working.  

2. A breakpoint is how you pause the execution of code in the JavaScript debugger. Kind of like the actual pause button.

3. A call stack is the queue of functions in your scriptsheet being called.  If a function has been invoked it will move onto the call stack and will be removed after it has finished.
