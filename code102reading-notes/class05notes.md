# Reading Notes Class 05: Design web pages with CSS

### What is the purpose of CSS?

- Changing how the HTML is presented to users. HTML and CSS work hand and hand. CSS Changes the styles of the HTML Elements

### What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

1. External (Utilizing a style sheet)
2. Internal (Utilizing `<style></style>` in head element of your HTML)
3. Inline (Putting the CSS in the actual HTML element `<p style="color: blue">`)

### Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.

- `p {
  color: red;
}`
