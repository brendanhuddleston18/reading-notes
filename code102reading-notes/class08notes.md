# Operators and Loops

### What is an `expression` in JavaScript

- "Valid unit of code that resolves to a value"
- 2 Types: expressions that have side effects (assigning values), expressions that evaluate

### Why would we use a loop in our code?

- To have your computer do an action repeatedly

### When does a `for` loop stop executing?

- When the condition it was given evaluates to false

### How many times will a `while` loop execute?

- As long as the condition it was given is still true.

### My own notes

- LOGICAL OR --> `||`
- LOGICAL AND --> `&&`
- LOGICAL NOT --> `!` "opposite" `!true` = false
