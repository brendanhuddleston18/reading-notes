### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. **Code completion** which will display possible suggestions based on what you are currently typing.
2. **Syntax highlighting** which will colorize your text based on attributes.
3. **A nice variety of themes** which will allow you to change the overall color of the text editor. (Instead of the text, this effects the background of the editor)
4. **Variety of extensions** which act as plugins for your text editor, allowing different capabilities and tools.

### What do the following commands do?

1. _pwd_ "Print Working Directory"- displays which directory(folder) you are currently in
2. _ls_ "List"- Lists the contents of the current directory
3. _cd_ "Change Directory"- Changes the current directory to whatever you specify
4. _mkdir_ "Make Directory" - Makes a new directory inside the folder you're currently in
5. _touch_ - Makes a new file inside the folder you're currently in

### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?

1. _cd projects_ Changes current directory to the _projects_ folder
2. _mkdir new-project_ Makes a new directory called _new-project_ (In the projects folder)
3. _touch new-project/newfile.md_ Makes a new markdown file called _newfile_ (In the new-project folder)
4. _cd.._ Goes back to the cd projects directory
5. _ls projects/new-project_ Lists the content of the new-project folder which should be newfile.md
