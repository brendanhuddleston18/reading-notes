# Programming with JavaScript

### What is `control flow`?

- Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- Code is run in order (First line to Last line) unless it runs across conditionals and loops (They can change the control flow)

### What is a JavaScript `function`?

- A block of code designed to perform a particular task, executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)

### What does it mean to `invoke` - or `call` - a function

- It's a way to start the code inside a function. (Have it do its job)

### What are the parenthesis `()` for when you define a function?

- Invokes the function
- Without the `()` you might return the function not the function result

### My own notes

`function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}`

- Functions can be used similar to variables, if you declare a variable inside a function it can only be used inside that function (It's Local)
